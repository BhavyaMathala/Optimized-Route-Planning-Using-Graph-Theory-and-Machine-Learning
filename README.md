# Optimized Route Planning Using Graph Theory and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an optimized route planning application that utilizes graph theory and machine learning algorithms for route optimization and traffic prediction. The application takes traffic data as input and provides efficient routes for various destinations, enhancing navigation efficiency.

## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Calculate the most efficient routes based on traffic data and road conditions.
- **Traffic Prediction**: Predict future traffic conditions using machine learning algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for users to input their requirements.
- **Data Visualization**: Display traffic patterns and route options graphically.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `sklearn` for implementing machine learning models
  - `networkx` for graph theory implementations
- **Database**: SQLite for data storage
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook
