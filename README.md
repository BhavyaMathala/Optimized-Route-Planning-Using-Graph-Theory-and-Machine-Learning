# Optimized Route Planning Using Graph Theory and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize route planning by calculating the shortest paths between cities using graph theory (Dijkstra’s algorithm) and predicting travel times using a machine learning model. The project combines C++ for graph-based pathfinding and Python for machine learning predictions, with MySQL used to store city, route, and traffic data.

## Features
- **Graph Theory**: Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest paths between cities.
- **Machine Learning**: Predict travel times based on traffic, weather, and other factors.
- **MySQL Integration**: Store and query city and route data efficiently.
